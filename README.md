# Ymir SCSS Framework

Flexible SCSS framework to act as the starting point of all my projects.

Much of the work here is based on Harry Robert's fine work on the InuitCSS project. It also adheres to his [ITCSS principle](https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss) and his [CSS Guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es/).

It was originally created for a project I was working on at [Bikesoup](bikesoup.com), but unfortunately never saw the light of day.

Since then, I've been using it as my boilerplate to kick start projects, and have slowing been growing and changing it to my needs.
